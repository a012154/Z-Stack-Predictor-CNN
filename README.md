# Z-Stack Predictor with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of a CNN model designed to predict Z-stacks in microscopy images.

## Overview

In microscopy, Z-stacking is a method used to capture 3D images (or Z-stacks). This project aims to predict the Z-coordinates in such images using deep learning techniques.

## Features

- Custom dataset loader for Z-stack images.
- CNN model with multiple convolutional layers.
- Training script with early stopping and learning rate reduction on plateau.
- Visualization tools for training and validation losses.
